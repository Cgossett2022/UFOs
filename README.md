# UFOs

## Overview
In this project, I helped Dana build an analysis on UFO sightings. In order to do this, I started with a Javascript array of data, which included the date, city, state, country, and shape for each UFO sighting. Next, I created an additional Javascript file, which included filters and the table structure for the Webpage. Lastly, I used HTML and CSS to read the Javacript files and build the Webpage.

## Results
Dana can now use the Webpage to filter the data on any of the five criteria. All she has to do is provide an input and click on the table, and then the Webpage will loop through the data and produce an updated table.

To reset the table, Dana would need to clear out her inputs. She can now add new filters and perform additional analysis.
