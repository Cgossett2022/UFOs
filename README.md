# UFOs

## Overview
In this project, I helped Dana build an analysis on UFO sightings. In order to do this, I started with a Javascript array of data, which included the date, city, state, country, and shape for the suspected UFO. Next, I created an additional Javascript file, which included filters and the table structure for the data. Lastly, I used HTML and CSS to read the Javacript files and build the Webpage.

## Results
Dana can now use the webpage to filter the data on any of the five criteria. All she has to do is provide an input and click on the table, and then the webpage will loop through the results and produce an updated table.

To reset the table, Dana would need to clear out her inputs. Now she can add new filters and perform additional analysis.
