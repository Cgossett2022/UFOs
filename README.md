# UFOs

## Overview
In this project, I helped Dana build an analysis on UFO sightings. In order to do this, I started with a Javascript array of data, which included the data, city, state, country, and shape for the suspected UFO. Next, I created an additional Javascript file, which included filters and the table structure for the data. Lastly, I used HTML and CSS to read the Javacript files and build the Webpage.
